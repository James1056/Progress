# Project Proposal:
## Progress,
###### Social Media focussing on people who go to the gym:


Description:
  "Progress" is a platform which allows people of all abilities at the gym to talk to one another 
  either to help each other progress with their fitness, to motivate one another, to find a workout
  partner and develop. 
  
  The objective of this platform is to encourage poeple to engage in fitness and the gym users who may 
  have previously been intimidated by the gym. By creating a platform that allows people of different  
  ability levels to communicate this will allow for hints and tips to be passed between gym users and 
  to reduce the intimidation new users feel when going to the gym for the first time. 
  
  The platform will take the form of a website. The features of the platform are:
  Private messaging features,
  Posting questions and answers,
  Posting videos,
  Reacting to posts,
  Publicizing services (i.e. personal training),
  Differnent users of different levels (each level has different features)
